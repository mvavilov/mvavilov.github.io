### ðŸ“± **Responsive Design**
Works perfectly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

### ðŸ“š **Dynamic Publications**
Publications are automatically loaded from arXiv using your name.

### ðŸ‘¥ **Team Management**
Student photos and names are automatically displayed based on filename.

## How to Update Website Content

### 1. Adding Photos

**Professor Photo:**
1. Save your professional photo as `professor.jpg` in the `images/` folder
2. The website will automatically display it in place of the placeholder

**Team Photo:**
1. Save your team photo as `team.jpg` in the `images/` folder
2. The website will automatically display it at the bottom of the homepage

**Photo Requirements:**
- Format: JPG or PNG
- Professor photo: 800x600 pixels or similar aspect ratio
- Team photo: 1200x800 pixels or similar wide format
- File size: Keep under 2MB for fast loading

### 2. Managing Research Directions

#### **Adding a New Research Direction:**

1. **Create the folder structure:**
   ```
   research-directions/
   â””â”€â”€ your-new-research-area/
       â”œâ”€â”€ direction.md
       â”œâ”€â”€ images/
       â”‚   â””â”€â”€ research-image.jpg
       â””â”€â”€ members/
           â”œâ”€â”€ student-name-1.jpg
           â””â”€â”€ student-name-2.jpg
   ```

2. **Create `direction.md` with this format:**
   ```yaml
   ---
   title: "Your Research Area Title"
   order: 5
   keywords: ["keyword1", "keyword2", "keyword3"]
   papers:
     - title: "Paper Title"
       authors: "Author list"
       journal: "Journal name"
       year: 2024
       url: "https://arxiv.org/abs/xxxx.xxxxx"
   ---

   Brief description of your research area. This text appears on the homepage card.
   ```

3. **Add the research image** to `images/research-image.jpg`

4. **Add student photos** to `members/` folder (filename becomes display name)

5. **Update the website data** by running: `./update_research.sh`

#### **Updating Existing Research Directions:**

- **Change description**: Edit the content in `direction.md`
- **Add/remove papers**: Update the `papers` section in `direction.md`
- **Add/remove students**: Add/remove photos in the `members/` folder
- **Change research image**: Replace `images/research-image.jpg`
- **After any changes**: Run `./update_research.sh` to update the website

#### **Student Photo Naming:**
- `john-smith.jpg` displays as "John Smith"
- `mary-johnson.jpg` displays as "Mary Johnson"
- Use hyphens for spaces, lowercase filenames

### 3. Adding News Items

Edit `index.md` and find the "News Section". Add new items at the top:

```html
<div class="news-item">
    <div class="news-date">Month Year</div>
    <div class="news-content">
        Your news content here...
    </div>
</div>
```

**Example:**
```html
<div class="news-item">
    <div class="news-date">January 2025</div>
    <div class="news-content">
        Our paper on quantum error correction was accepted at Physical Review Letters.
    </div>
</div>
```

### 4. Updating Research Directions

**Important**: After adding, removing, or modifying research directions, you must run the update script:

```bash
./update_research.sh
```

This script:
- Scans your `research-directions/` folder
- Generates the data file that powers the website
- Shows you which research directions are currently active
- Works with both local development and GitHub Pages

**When to run the update script:**
- After adding a new research direction folder
- After removing a research direction folder  
- After modifying `direction.md` files
- After changing research direction content

### 5. Publications

Publications are **completely automatic**! The system:
- Searches arXiv for papers with "Maxim Vavilov" as author
- Filters for quantum physics papers
- Displays the 50 most recent papers
- Updates automatically when visitors view the Publications page

**No manual updates needed for publications!**

### 5. SEEQC Advisory Information

The SEEQC advisory board card is automatically displayed. To update:
- Edit the text in the "SEEQC Advisory Card" section of `index.md`
- The logo is stored in `/assets/seeqc_us_logo.jpg`

## Troubleshooting

### Research Direction Not Showing
1. Check that the folder is in `research-directions/`
2. Verify `direction.md` exists with proper front matter
3. Check YAML formatting (indentation matters!)
4. Ensure `order` field is a number

### Images Not Displaying
1. Check exact filenames match requirements
2. Verify images are in correct subfolders
3. Check file extensions (.jpg, .png)
4. Ensure images aren't corrupted

### Student Names Not Displaying
1. Check filename format: `firstname-lastname.jpg`
2. Use lowercase filenames
3. Use hyphens (not underscores or spaces)
4. Ensure photos are in `members/` subfolder

## Quick Reference

### Most Common Tasks

1. **Add a new student to a research direction:**
   - Save photo as `firstname-lastname.jpg` in the appropriate `members/` folder

2. **Update research description:**
   - Edit the content below the `---` in `direction.md`

3. **Add a new research paper:**
   - Add to the `papers:` section in `direction.md`

4. **Add news:**
   - Add a new `news-item` div at the top of the news section in `index.md`

5. **Change photos:**
   - Replace `images/professor.jpg` or `images/team.jpg`
