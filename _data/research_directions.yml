    Theoretical investigations into fundamental aspects of quantum information processing, including quantum entanglement, quantum communication protocols, and the quantum-classical boundary.

    Our theoretical research explores the fundamental limits and possibilities of quantum information processing, with particular focus on understanding how quantum mechanical effects can be harnessed for computational and communication advantages over classical systems.
